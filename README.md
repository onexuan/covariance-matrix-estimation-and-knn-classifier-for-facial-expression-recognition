# Covariance Matrix Estimation and knn Classifier for Facial Expression Recognition

This program is for facial expression recognition on FaceWarehouse dataset. It can recognize 6 human expressions.
There are several algorithms such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Multi-scales LBPs known appearance-feature based method and the approach of curvature measurements known as geometric-feature based method implementing in this system. 

# Solved
  - Address many challenges: diverse age, gender, skins, lighting changes even dramatically illumination.
  - Interesting discovery: the normal feature plays important role in performance and not yet explain accordingly.

 # Limitation
  - Vary head pose (propose the approach of Iterative Closest Point to rotate the 3D face surface to fixed position )

### Installation:
* OpenCV
* The Point Cloud Library
* C++
